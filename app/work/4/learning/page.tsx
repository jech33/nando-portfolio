                <b>Organization is key</b>. It is tempting to think design ends
                when screens are handed off to developers, but it is even more
                important to have a clear file structure that is in sync with
                developersâ€™ expectations.

                constant contact with the development team to ensure all the
                proposed solutions are being built properly.
