          As per my multipotentialite nature, I <b>majored in Communication</b>{" "}
          and began working as a <b>filmmaker</b>, where I learned about the art
          of captivating and telling stories through images.

          On this storytelling journey, I began to become quite interested in
          those who consumed stories: how they thought, what determined their
          tastes.{" "}
          <b>
            Yearning to understand more about the audience and how to help them
          </b>{" "}
          naturally led me to learn about and fall in love with user-centered
          (UX) design.

          Today, my purpose is to use design, storytelling and any creative
          means in order to <b>serve others</b>.

          I also like <b>creating music with my guitar</b>, the original
          storytellerâ€™s instrument, and <b>writing short articles</b> in my free
          time. You can find me on{" "}
