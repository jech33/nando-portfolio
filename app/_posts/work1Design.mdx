## Building out the design

I went through a **benchmarking process** with the most popular
roommate search apps in Latin America in order to determine what
features the app should have.

I built **user personas** to determine which user profiles would
use the app and how to design it around their needs.

The chosen visual style was based on **minimalism** and the need
to convey **peace and calm** to the user.

I performed **4 user testing sessions** with Colombian students
whose needs aligned with wanting to find a roommate in another
place.

- **Improved readability** by increasing the size of certain
  texts.

- **Expanded the initial questionnaire** by adding fields to
  input location and budget.

- **Strengthened the roommate search feature** by adding data
  for hobbies and occupation.

- **Empowered the user** by adding an option to upload photos
  of their living spaces.
