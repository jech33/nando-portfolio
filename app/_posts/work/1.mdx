# Find the best, most compatible roommates

The **mobile app** millave is meant for Colombian students who want to move
to Bogotá and want to **find a roommate** with whom they have
compatibility. The name comes from Colombian slang; close friends are usually
called a llave.

## What was my role?

This was my **final project** for the UX/UI Design Diploma from Acámica.

It represented my first learning experience in the world of UX. It involved
building an app through all the steps of the design thinking process, **from ideation to prototyping**.

export default ({ children }) => <>{children}</>;
